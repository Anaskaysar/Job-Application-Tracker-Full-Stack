# Monetization Plan (Safe Zones)

This document outlines the proposed non-intrusive advertisement and revenue-generating strategies for JobTracker.

## Where to Show Ads (Safe Zones)

### 1️⃣ Dashboard – Side Banner (Best)
- **Location**: Right sidebar (desktop), Below content (mobile).
- **Size**: Small card (not full width).
- **Frequency**: Always visible but static.
- **Example content**: 💼 Resume review service, 🎓 Interview prep, 🔗 Partner tools.

### 2️⃣ Empty / Low-Content States (High Value)
- **Context**: When no jobs are added, or no interviews scheduled.
- **Example**: “No applications yet 👀 Want help getting callbacks?”

### 3️⃣ After Success Actions (Soft Moment)
- **Triggers**: Job added, Interview scheduled, Offer marked.
- **Layout**: Small toast or card.
- **Example**: “Nice progress 🚀 Want tools to improve interview chances?”

## Goals
- Maintain premium feel.
- Avoid frustration by keeping ads static or useful.
- No blocking of core functionality.
