## 📄 Generating PDF with Diagrams

Standard PDF converters often fail to render Mermaid diagrams. To get a professional PDF with all diagrams (Architecture, DB, Flow) perfectly rendered:

1. **Open the rendering template**: Open [project_report_perfect.html](project_report_perfect.html) in your browser (Chrome/Edge/Safari).
2. **Export to PDF**: Click the blue **"Export to PDF"** button at the top of the page.
3. **Save**: In the print dialog, ensure "Save as PDF" is selected and click Save.

This ensures all colorful diagrams from the VS Code preview are preserved in your final document.
